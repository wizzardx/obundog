# 🐕 ObunDog

**Rebranding Linux with loyalty and memes — ObunDog is the open-source daemon we deserve.**

ObunDog is a post-penguin mascot initiative for Ubuntu 26.06 and beyond — a sleek, secure, emotionally resonant Great Dane who embodies the spirit of modern Linux. From CLI companion to desktop guardian, ObunDog is here to serve belly rubs, secure your daemons, and bark joy into your syslogs.
